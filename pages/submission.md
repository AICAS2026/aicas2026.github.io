The AICAS 2026 Organizing Committee invites interested authors to
submit their previously unpublished research contributions from a
broad range of topics related to Artificial Intelligence Circuits and
Systems and its connections with other areas.

Full-length papers should have a maximum length of five (5) pages in
PDF with the fifth page reserved for references only. The paper format
should be following [the IEEE conference templates for A4 page
size](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Papers must be submitted anonymously as they will undergo a
blind review. No author names, contact information, affiliations,
acknowledgements, and funding sources should appear in the initial
manuscript. Prior work (including work by the authors) should be cited
using the third person.

Submitted manuscripts must describe original work which has not been
submitted, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.
