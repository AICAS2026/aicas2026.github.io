## About IEEE Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Circuits
and Systems (CAS) Society is one of the largest societies in IEEE,
with more than 20K members, including more than 8K student
members. The Society has a strong global presence through 68 chapters,
59 joint chapters, and 124 student branch chapters. It supports a rich
body of knowledge through 19 journals and fosters collaboration and
innovation through 9 flagship and 34 co-sponsored conferences.

Artificial Intelligence is driving a revolution in information
technology and many other industries. New computing paradigms are
required to support emerging AI algorithms and applications running
across various platforms, from edge devices to cloud servers, and from
circuit to system levels. Addressing this challenge and opportunity,
the AICAS conference has been established as the premier conference of
the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society to promote and facilitate
state-of-the-art research, innovation, and development activities at
the frontiers of artificial intelligence circuits and systems.

Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length papers in a
maximum of 5 pages, anonymously via the conference website, of which
four are for technical content and with an optional 5th page
containing only references. Proposals for special sessions, live
demos, and tutorials are welcome. Submitted papers must describe
original work not submitted to other journals or conferences. Authors
are expected to present their papers in person at the
conference. While the conference proceedings will be submitted to the
IEEE Xplore® digital library, the selected papers will be recommended
to the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for AI (TCASAI) or
IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems (TVLSI) for a Special Section.

## The AICAS 2026 will be held in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam, from 16-18 September 2026.
- Theme: "Innovating AI Circuits and Systems for a Smarter Future:
  From Edge to Cloud and Beyond" – focusing on the frontier of
  AI-driven computing paradigms to foster innovation and emerging
  businesses in one of the highest economic growth regions in the
  world.
- Experienced, regional, balanced, and gender diverse team from
  academia and industry with strong support from the government and
  local companies.
- Approximately 1,000 people worldwide will attend the conference,
  including students, professors, industry professionals, and
  government officials.
- The conference focuses on the intersection of artificial
  intelligence and hardware realization. The topics include in-memory
  computing, AI architectures and circuits, emerging devices,
  neuromorphic systems, hardware/software co-design, and AI-driven
  applications for IoT, autonomous vehicles, and the metaverse.
