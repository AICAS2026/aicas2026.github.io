## Visa Assistant

In case a visa is required, you can select one of the following ways
to apply for the visa:
- Apply for E-visa. For more information, you can visit the [E-visa page](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt) by Vietnam Immigration Departement.
- Contact a Vietnamese Diplomatic Mission in your country directly and
  apply for a visa.
- Scan your passport and send it together with your desired landing
  airport to the conference local chair, Mr. NGUYEN The Anh (email:
  anhntiti [at] vnu.edu.vn). The conference local chair will request the
  conference travel agent partner to apply for a visa for you. When
  the application is approved (normally after 3-5 business days), the
  chair will inform you of the application number. You do not need to
  go the Vietnamese Diplomatic Mission, but can use the application
  number to get the visa stamped at the airport. You will need to pay
  a fee of 35 USD (10 USD for the service fee and 25 USD for the visa
  application fee for one-month stay). The visa application fee may
  vary depending on the length of your stay.
  
In case of urgency, please contact our local chair and/or conference secretariat.
