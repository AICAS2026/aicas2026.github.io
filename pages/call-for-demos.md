<center><h1>Call for live demonstrations</h1>
<h5><a href="/images/cfp-live-demos.pdf" target="_blank">(PDF version)</a></h5><br/></center>

The Organizing Committee of AICAS 2026 invites proposals for Live
Demonstrations to be held during the conference in Ha Long Bay,
VIETNAM, September 16–18, 2026. The live demonstrations will be
carried out in presentation booths with ample space to set up a
working system, whether it is an interactive software on a laptop, a
hardware setup, or a system acquiring signals from a human. Conference
attendees are invited to experience the demonstrations directly, to
interact with and challenge them. Outstanding live demonstrations will
be considered for the AICAS Best Live Demonstration Award.


Authors are invited to submit a one-page demo description through the
online paper submission system, using the same page formatting as for
regular AICAS papers. The one-page demo description needs to be based
on either an already published paper as a demo for the first time or a
new paper submitted to AICAS 2026. During submission of the one-page
demo description, authors should select "Live Demonstrations" as the
Primary Track.

**The one-page demo description must contain the following information:**

1. **Title and Reference**: The demonstration title must begin with “Live
   Demonstration:”. If the one-page demo description is based on an
   already published paper, include at least one reference to your
   published paper about the scientific background of your live
   demonstration. If the one page demo description is based on new
   paper submitted to AICAS 2026, please include the submission ID of
   your AICAS paper in the demo description.
2. **Demonstration Setup**: Describe the equipment you will bring to
   AICAS 2026. Include a photograph and/or screenshot. Only a power
   plug, a table and display stand will be provided. Demonstrators are
   responsible for the transportation of their own equipment to the
   meeting site. Indicate any special requirements such as extra space
   for demonstrating robotic movement or other requirements which the
   organizers should be aware of.
3. **Visitor Experience**: Explain the way in which a visitor experiences
   and interacts with your demonstration, how it reveals the essence
   of your work, furthers understanding, and what the visitor will
   learn.
4. **Optional Video**: For the initial submission only, authors can also
   include an optional link to a video (max 5min) about their
   demo. This video is only meant to facilitate the review process,
   and does not substitute for the live demo!
