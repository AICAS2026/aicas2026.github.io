The AICAS 2026 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials to
complement the regular program. Tutorials should provide in-depth
coverage of emerging topics, offering a comprehensive overview and
insights into the latest advancements for both researchers and
practitioners. Tutorial proposals to the AICAS 2026 should include:

- Title of the tutorial
- Indicate short (1.5  hour) session or half-day (3 hours) session
- Abstract 
- Names, affiliations, pictures, short bios, contact details, and
  expertise of presenters
- Submit via Google form

Note that important aspects in evaluating Tutorial proposals include
the timeliness of the topic, quality/track record of the proposers,
and expected value added to the overall technical program.
