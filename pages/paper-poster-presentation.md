### Presentation guidelines

presentation and 5 minutes for Q&As. All presentations will be
conducted using a PC previously set up in each session
room. Presenters should bring their presentation file (pptx, or pdf)
on a memory stick and hand it to the room monitoring volunteer at
least 15 minutes prior to the start of their session.

lunch. Poster spaces will be allocated. Clips for hanging them on the
grids will be provided on site.
