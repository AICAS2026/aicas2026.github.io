### Presentation guidelines

The time slot per paper is 20 minutes, typically 15 minutes for
presentation and 5 minutes for Q&As. All presentations will be
conducted using a PC that has been set up in each session
room. Presenters should bring their presentation file (pptx, or pdf)
on a memory stick and hand it to the room monitoring volunteer at
least 15 minutes prior to the start of their session.

### Poster guidelines

The poster must be printed beforehand in A0 format (84.1 x 118.9
cm) in portrait orientation. Grids will be set up after lunch. 
Poster spaces will be allocated. Clips for hanging them on the
grids will be provided on-site.
