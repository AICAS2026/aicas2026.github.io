The Organizing Committee of AICAS 2026 invites proposals for Special
Sessions to be held during the conference in Ha Long Bay, VIETNAM,
September 16–18, 2026.

Special sessions complement the main program by focusing on emerging
topics or novel applications. Proposals should target timely,
impactful research areas. While all Circuits and Systems topics are
welcome, interdisciplinary research and the conference‘s innovation
themes are particularly encouraged:

- Circuits and systems for AI
- Architecture for AI computing
- Emerging computing devices and materials for AI
- Hardware/software co-design and design automation for AI systems
- Neuromorphic and bioinspired circuits, processors, systems and their applications
- Emerging applications: IoT, healthcare, smart factories, environment, robotics, autonomous vehicles, drones, AR/VR, metaverse
- AI for Circuits and Systems
- AI for Future Wireless Communications

Proposals should include the following information (3 pages max.):

1. Title & Abstract: A clear, concise title and abstract that outline
   the session's core topic and scope.
2. Rationale: Justify the topic’s novelty and timeliness, elaborate on
its relevance to the CAS community, and demonstrate alignment with the
conference's innovation themes.
3. Proposed Speakers: Submit a complete list of presentations and
speakers (for each associated paper).  Technical sessions typically
require 5 papers. For special cases (e.g., invited industry speakers
or extended talks), proposals for sessions with fewer papers are
permitted.
4. Short Biographies: Include brief bio-sketches of the session
proposers.
