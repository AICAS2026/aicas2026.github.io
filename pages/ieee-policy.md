### IEEE Code of Conduct
The 8<sup>th</sup> IEEE International Conference on Artificial
Intelligence Circuits and Systems (IEEE AICAS 2026) is committed to
providing an inclusive and harassment-free environment in all
interactions regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, race, or religion. This commitment extends to all
IEEE AICAS 2026 sponsored events and services (webinars, committee
meetings, networking functions, online forums, chat rooms, and social
media) and any interaction regardless of affiliation or position. As a
community that aims to share ideas and freedom of thought and
expression, it is essential that the interaction between attendees
take place in an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of
every person by being respectful of all. IEEE AICAS 2026 does not tolerate
harassment in any form. Harassment is any form of behavior intended to
exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Harassment includes, but is
not limited to, the use of abusive or degrading language,
intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of threatening
behavior is encouraged to immediately report the incident to the
Conference Manager . All information shared will be kept
confidential. In cases where a public response is deemed necessary,
the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential
unless those individuals consent otherwise.

IEEE AICAS 2026 reserves the right to take appropriate action to
foster an inclusive and respectful environment. Attendees violating
these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund, at
the sole discretion of the conference organizers. In addition,
attendees are subject to the [IEEE Code of
Conduct](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/code-of-conduct).

Please contact the [Conference Manager](mailto:hieubd@vnu.edu.vn) if
you experience, observe, or have knowledge of behavior in violation of
the Code of Conduct or have any questions about the Code of Conduct
and Inclusivity & Diversity at IEEE AICAS 2026.

IEEE, when and where ever those individuals are conducting IEEE
business or participating in IEEE events or activities, shall maintain
an environment free of Discrimination, including Harassment, Bullying,
and Retaliation. Discrimination or harassment of IEEE AICAS 2026

### IEEE Event Conduct and Safety Statement Language

IEEE believes that science, technology, and engineering are
fundamental human activities, for which openness, international
collaboration, and the free flow of talent and ideas are
essential. Its meetings, conferences, and other events seek to enable
engaging, thought-provoking conversations that support IEEE’s core
mission of advancing technology for humanity. Accordingly, IEEE is
committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment
to all participants, including staff and vendors, at IEEE-related
events. IEEE has no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or
bullying in any form at IEEE-related events. All participants have the
right to pursue shared interests without harassment or discrimination
in an environment that supports diversity and inclusion. Participants
are expected to adhere to these principles and respect the rights of
others. IEEE seeks to provide a secure environment at its
events. Participants should report any behavior inconsistent with the
principles outlined here, to on [site
staff](mail:anhntiti@vnu.edu.vn), security or venue personnel, or to
[eventconduct@ieee.org](mail:eventconduct@ieee.org).
