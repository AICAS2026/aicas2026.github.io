The Organizing Committee of AICAS 2026 invites proposals for Cross-Society Special
Sessions to be held during the conference in Ha Long Bay, VIETNAM,
September 16-18, 2026.

Cross-society special sessions are designed to complement the main program by focusing on emerging topics or innovative applications that span across traditional boundaries. Proposals should target timely, impactful research areas that are likely to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaboration and attract board interest. All papers submitted to Cross-Society Special Sessions will undergo the same rigorous peer-review process as regular submissions to ensure the highest quality standards.

Each Cross-Society Special Session must be jointly organized by members from at
least two different IEEE societies (with supporting letter from the conference organizer). Organizers are expected to have successfully organized a similar special session at the respective flagship conferences of at least two IEEE societies. This helps in building momentum and visibility for the topic, and in attracting high-quality submissions from a broad spectrum of researchers.


Proposals should include the following information (3 pages max.):

1. Title & Abstract: A clear, concise title and abstract.
2. Rationale: Justify the topic’s novelty and timeliness, elaborate on its relevance to the AICAS community, and alignment with the conference’s innovation themes.
3. Proposed Speakers: Submit a complete list of presentations and speakers (in each associated paper). Technical sessions are normally expected to have 5 papers.
4. Short Biographies: Include brief bio-sketches of the proposers.
5. Email Support: A supporting email will be required at the submission of proposal from other societies. Please contact Chixiao Chen (cxchen@fudan.edu.cn) to obtain email support from AICAS'26 if you need it to get support from us.
