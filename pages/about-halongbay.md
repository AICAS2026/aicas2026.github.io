"Covering an area of 65,650 ha and including 1,133 islands and islets,
Ha Long Bay - Cat Ba Archipelago is located in the Northeast of Viet
Nam, within Quang Ninh Province and Hai Phong City. Comprised of a
multitude of limestone islands of islets rising from the sea, in a
variety of sizes and shapes and presenting picturesque, unspoiled
nature, Ha Long Bay - Cat Ba Archipelago is a spectacular seascape
sculpted by nature. As the most extensive and best known example of
marine - invaded tower karst, Ha Long Bay - Cat Ba Archipelago is one
of the world's mots important areas of fengcong (clusters of conical
peaks) and fenglin (isolated tower features) karst. Additionally, the
exceptionally beautiful landscape is also dominated by the typical
ecosystems."

Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and popular travel
destination in Quang Ninh province, Vietnam. The name Ha Long means
"descending dragon". Administratively, the bay belongs to Hạ Long
city, Cẩm Phả city, and is a part of Vân Đồn district. The bay
features thousands of limestone karsts and islets in various shapes
and sizes. Hạ Long Bay is a center of a larger zone that includes Bai
Tu Long Bay to the northeast, and Cát Bà Island to the
southwest. These larger zones share a similar geological,
geographical, geomorphological, climate, and cultural characters.

Hạ Long Bay has an area of around 1,553 km2 (600 sq mi), including
1,969 islets, most of which are limestone. The core of the bay has an
area of 334 km2 (129 sq mi) with a high density of 775 islets. The
limestone in this bay has gone through 500 million years of formation
in different conditions and environments. The evolution of the karst
in this bay has taken 20 million years under the impact of the
tropical wet climate. The geo-diversity of the environment in the
area has created biodiversity, including a tropical evergreen
biosystem and a seashore biosystem. Hạ Long Bay is home to 14
endemic floral species and 60 endemic faunal species.

## Top things to do in Ha Long Bay

### Cruise the bay

Nothing beats spending watching the sun set over the calm waters of Ha
Long Bay, and waking up to a serene morning surrounded by
karsts. Relaxing on a sun deck surrounded by magnificent panoramas is
the highlight of many a trip.
### Take a scenic flight over the bay

From water level, the islands are impressive, with their unique
formations and imaginative names like Fighting Cock, Calf’s Head,
Stone Dog and Incense Burner (featured on the back of the Vietnamese
200,000d note). However, for a completely different perspective, take
to the skies on [a 25-minute scenic seaplane flight](https://www.seaplanes.vn/en/) and the islands
start looking more like mini mountain ranges snaking through the
sea. The water landings and take-offs alone are almost worth the
money.

### Explore a floating village

Ha Long Bay is not just a UNESCO-listed site, it's also home to a
number of fishing communities who have lived on the water for
centuries. Take a boat tour around a floating village for a glimpse of
this rare and beautiful way of life.

### Paddle out in a kayak

Even if you’re not an experienced kayaker, you can’t miss the chance
to navigate your way around Ha Long’s gorgeous seascape. Just before
sunset is an ideal time to kayak to see quiet lagoons and fishing
boats up close.

### Spelunking in Sung Sot, Me Cung, and Thien Cung Caves

Beneath their rocks and jungled exteriors, many of Ha Long’s ancient
karsts have been carved out by rain and water currents. Take a look
inside these geological wonders on foot — some are a squeeze while
others are enormous.


## Things to do in Ha Long City

### Get a bird’s eye view of Halong on a cable car ride

Alternatively, the Queen Cable Car is a great way to get panoramic
views of Halong Bay and Halong City from above. Part of the Sun World
Halong complex, the cable car can fit a record-breaking 230 passengers
per cabin and travels between the two halves of Halong City, with Sun
World’s Amusement Complex on one side and Ba Deo Hill on the other,
with lots of outdoor games and theme park activities on either end.

### Explore Halong City

More than the gateway to Halong Bay, Halong City has its fair share of
tourist attractions. Hike up to the 200m-high (656 ft) viewpoint on
Bai Tho Mountain for sweeping views. Originally called Truyen Dang
(meaning “lightning”), the mountain was home to an important guard
post of the Northeast gate thousands of years ago, whose task was to
light the way for boats on the bay.

Families will enjoy the Sun World Halong theme park, with games,
roller coasters, a ferris wheel, and one of the largest water parks in
Southeast Asia. There's also the excellent Quang Ninh Museum and
Library, designed by Spanish architect Salvador Perez Arroyo, and a
fun night market inside the Halong Marine Plaza.
